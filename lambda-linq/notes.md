## Extensions Methods

In practice, programmers often have to add new functionality to already existing code. If the code is available, we can simply add the required functionality and recompile. When a given assembly (.exe) or .dll file has already been compiled, the source code is not available , a common way to extend functionality of the types is through inheritance. This approach can be quite difficult to apply, due to the fact that we will have to change the instances of the base class with the instances of the derived one to be able to use our new functionality. Unfortunately, that is the least of our problems. If the type we want to inherit is marked with the keyword sealed, inheritance is not possible.
