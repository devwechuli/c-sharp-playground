# Interfaces

An interface in C# is a type definition similar to a class, except that is purely represents a contract between an object and its user. It can neither be directly instantiated as an object, nor can data members be defined. An interface contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that a non-abstract class or a struct must implement.
