# Methodology of Problem Solving

## Use Pen and Paper

The use of a pen and sheet of paper and the making of drafts and sketches when solving problems is something normal and natural, which every experienced mathematician, physicist and software engineer does when tasked with a non-trivial problem.

## Generate Ideas and Give Them a Try

The first thing to do is to sketch some sample examples for the problem on a piece of paper. When we have a real example of the problem in front of us, we can reflect on it and the ideas come.

When the idea is a fact, we need more examples in order to check if it a good one. Then we need some more examples drafted on paper to verify it again. We should be completely sure our solution is correct.Then we should go through our solution one more time, step by step, the same way like one actual computer program would do, and see if everything runs correctly.

The next thing to do is to try "braking" our solution and thinking of a case, in which our idea would not work properly (a counter-example). If we fail at that, then our idea is probably right. If our solution definitely has a flaw, we should think of a way to fix it. If our idea does not pass every test, we should invent a new one. The first idea that comes to your mind is not always the correct one.

Problem-solving is an iterative process, which represents the invention of ideas and then testing them over different examples until you reach one which seems to work correctly with every example that you could think of.

Sometimes it can take hours for you to try and find the right solution of a given problem. This is completely normal. Nobody has an ability to instantly find the correct solution of a problem, but surely the more experience you have the faster the good ideas will come. If a particular problem has something in common with one that you have solved in the past, then the proper idea will come to your mind more quickly, because one of the basic characteristics of the human brain is to work with analogies. The experience you get from solving given type of problems will help you with the invention of ideas for a solution of other analogical problems.

## Decompose the Task into Smaller SubTasks

Complex tasks can always be divided into smaller more manageable subtasks. There is not a single complex problem in the world that can been solved with one try. The correct formula for solving such a task is to split it into smaller simpler tasks, which have to be independent and different from one another. If these smaller subtasks prove to be complicated, we should split them again. This technique is called "divide and conquer".

## Verify Your Ideas

It seems that we have figured out everything. We have an idea. It seems to work properly. The only thing for us to do is to check if our idea is correct or it is only correct in our minds. After that we can start with the implementation.

**How to verify an idea?** Usually this happens with the help of some examples. We should choose examples that fully cover all different cases, with our algorithm should be able to pass. The sample examples should not be too easy for your algorithm, but also they should not be so hard to be sketched. We call these certain types of examples "good representatives of the common case".

When verifying your ideas, choose your examples carefully. They should be simple and easy enough for you to be able to sketch them down by hand in a minute and at the same time they should represent most general case in which your idea should work. Your examples should be good representatives of the common case and cover as much cases as possible without being too big and complicated.

## If a Problem Occurs, Invent a New Idea!

When you find your idea is incorrect, the obvious thing to do is to invent a new, better idea. We can do this in two ways: we can either try to fix our old idea or create a completely new one.

        The creating of a solution for a computer programming problem is an iterative process, which consists of inventing ideas, verifying them and sometimes, when problem occurs, inventing new ones. Sometimes the first idea that comes to our mind is the right one, but most of the times we need to go through many different ideas until we reach the best one.
