1 My Basket of burdens
2 Is filled with the grief of my loss
3 It is so heavy to carry
4 Although this road I must cross.
5 
6 This pathway through life
7 Feels unbearable at times
8 And I don't have the strength
9 For this mountain I climb.
10 
11 The Basket's filled with sorrow
12 Oh, how I miss my love
13 At first, It's impossible to carry,
14 Where is my help from above?
15 
16 It's draining my strength
17 I can't do anymore
18 This pain goes so deep
19 Right down to my core.
20 
21 As I carry this Basket
22 I'll learn to manage the weight
23 Each step of the way
24 Will become easier they say. 
25 
26 But how do they know,
27 Have they been here before?
28 If so, where's their Basket
29 They're responsible for?
30 
31 This Basket of burdens
32 You can't see and can't touch
33 I carry it inside me
34 This pain is too much.
35 
36 Patience is needed to carry
37 This loss that I feel
38 A shoulder to lean on
39 So, someday I will heal.
40 
41 God sent my family
42 My friends and spirits unknown
43 So, I won't carry this Basket
44 For-ever alone
45 
46 Someday, I'll lay down my Basket
47 With burdens' no more
48 My pain will be gone
49 When, I cross through that door
50 
51 Then I'll know reason
52 For my Basket of Burdens
53 How God showed me His grace
54 When I couldn't cope with the season 
55 
56 Love and support that He gave
57 When His presence felt unknown
58 He was with me each step
59 When I felt so alone
