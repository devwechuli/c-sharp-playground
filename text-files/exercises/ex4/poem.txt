This is different
Three months have passed.
I'll never forget the day
Someone rang to tell me
That you'd gone away.

The hurt is the same,
Like an open wound.
There are days
I don't utter a sound.

Some days the pain is stronger.
It makes me sick and weak.
I can't stand this much longer.
I just sit here and weep.

I've shut my private door
And let no one in,
Locking myself in a box.
They try, but I won't give in.
