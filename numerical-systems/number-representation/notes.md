## Integer Representation

The largest number that can be represented, in binary form, in a computer depends on its word length. An n-bit word computer can hable a number as large as 2^n -1. Negative numbers are stored using 2's compliment. This is obtained by taking the 1's complement of the binary representation of the positive number and then adding 1 to it
