# Object-Oriented Programming Principles

**Classes** are a description (model) of real objects and events referred to as entities. Classes posses characteristics referred to as properties.

Classes also expose behavior known as methods. Methods and properties can be visible only within the scope of the class, which declared them and their descendants (private/protected) or visible to other classes (public)
Objects are instances of classes.

Object-oriented programming is the successor of procedural (structural) programming. Procedural programming describes programs as groups of reusable code units (procedures) which define input and output parameters.Procedural programs consist of procedures, which invoke each other.

The problem with procedural programming is that code reusability is hard and limited - Only procedures and it is hard to make them generic flexible. There is no easy way to work with abstract data structures with different implementations.

The object-oriented approach relies on the paradigm that each and every program works with data that describes entities (objects or events) from real life.
