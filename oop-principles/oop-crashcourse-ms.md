# Object-Oriented Programming (C#)

C# provides full support for object-oriented programming including encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

- **Encapsulation** means that a group of related properties, methods and other members are treated as a single unit or object
- **Inheritance** describes the ability to create new classes based on an existing class
- **Polymorphism** - means that you can have multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.
- **Abstraction** is a principle of object oriented programming language (OOP) and it is used to hide implementation details and display only essential features of the object. In Abstraction, by using access modifiers we can hide the required details of object and expose only necessary methods and properties through the reference of object.


Each class can have different class members that include properties that describe class data, methods that define class behavior and events that provide communication between different classes and objects.
