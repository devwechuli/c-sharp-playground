# Trees and Graphs

- binary trees, binary search trees and self balanacing binary search tree
- graph, types of graphs and how to represent a graph in the memory

# Tree Data Structures

Very often we have to describe a group of real life objects, which have such relation to one another that we cannot use linear data structures for their description. A tree-like data structure or branched data structure consists of a set of elements(nodes) which could be linked to other elements, sometimes hierarchially, sometimes not. Trees represent hierarchies, while graphs represent more general relationsh such as the map of a city

## Trees

Trees are very often used in programming, because they naturally represent all kinds of object hierarchies from our surroundings.
