# Linear Data Structures

Very often, in order to solve a given problem, we need to work with a sequence of elements. Depending on the task, we have to apply different operations on this set of data.
- Abstract data types(ADT)
- Linked list
- Doubly-linked list
- array-list
- stacks
- queue

## Abstract Data Structures

Very often, when we write programs, we have to work with many objects(data). Sometimes we add and remove elements, other times we would like to order them to process the data in another specific way. For this reason, different ways of storing data are developed, depending on the task. Most frequently, these elements are ordered in some way. At this point, we come to the need of data structures -a set od data organized on the basis of logical and mathematical laws. Very often, the right data structure makes the program much more efficient - we could save memory and execution time.
