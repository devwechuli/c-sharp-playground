## Method Overloading

When in a class, a method is declared and its name coincides with the name of another method, but their signatures differ by their parameters list(**count of the method's parameters** or **the way they are arranged**), we say that there are different variations/overloads of that method(method overloading). There are two things required in C# to specify a method signature, the parameter type and the order in which the parameters are listed.

Overloaded methods are invoked by their name and their special order or type of arguments

The return type is not part of the method signature
