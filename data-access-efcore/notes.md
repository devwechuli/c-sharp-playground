# Data Access in C# and .NET Core

Data is a very important piece in all enterprise applications and almost every other type of application you will need to develop. Data is usually stored in databases. An application usually has an object model that represents the data it deals with created in the form of classes.

At the backend of the application, you need to store this data in a reliable storage to be able to access it back when needed, it is like your archive. This is usually a database that has tables of data created with columns to represent the same data you are using in the application object model.

To load the data from the database into your application object model, and store or update the data back into the database from your application, you need a way to map the columns in the database tables to the properties of your application object model classes by storing some information to know what fields in the database should map to what properties in the application data model. This information is called metadata. And this mapper is referred to as **Object to Relational Mapper** or simply ORM.

The Object-Relational Mapper, or simply ORM, is an a programming technique of connecting an object model in an object-oriented programming languages to a relational database by using metadata as the descriptor of the object and data.

As an application developer you will not be building ORM for your application, in most cases, you will be using an ORM tool provided either by the framework you are using or by a third-party provider (for example, LINQ to SQL) that provides you with ready-to-use mapping functionality.

Entity Framework, or simply EF, is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with relational data from a database using domain-specific .NET objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write. Entity Framework is Microsoftâ€™s recommended data access technology for new applications.

EF Core is a lightweight, modern, extensible, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework.

EF Core supports many database engines like: Microsoft SQl Server, IBM Data Server (DB2), SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Some of these databases are natively supported by EF Core, while others are supported through third party providers using NuGet packages that need to be installed.

EF Core is the recommended data access technology for new applications and for applications that target .NET Core, such as Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and ASP.NET Core applications.

With EF Core, data access is performed using a `model`. A model is made up of entity classes and a derived context that represents a session with the database, allowing you to query and save data.
